[player], long time, no see.

PROF. OAK asked me to find you.
It would help our research to learn
more about how baby POKÃ©MON 
learn and grow under the care of
a trainer.

So could you keep this EGG with you?

Thank you, [player].

I'm sure it could be a helpful 
addition to your party!

Also, I heard that BILL is in
town!

If you don't know, BILL created
the PC storage system!

You should pay him a visit if you've 
got a chance.

Well, I'm off,
Good luck!
